Since Snowden the usage of encryption is steady growing. One of the key points is to encrypt the daily web usage. Each website should run SSL, but for website starter installing an SSL cert and keep it up to date is often to complicated.

And of course it comes with a price, even a standard SSL cert will cost you at least 10 euro per year.

But why paying for an SSL cert when you can have it free?

All shared hosting server support Lets Encrypt certificates!

You dont have to do anything, your website will simply recive (or has already) a valid SSL certificate issued by Lets Encrypt. Try it out!

In case you have already an valid SSl certificate it wont be replaced. SSL certs installed within Cpanel have priority so there wont be overwritten.

**The SSL cert will be automaticly installed and renewed by the system, there is nothing you need to do.**

If you have any further questions please contact our support team via email or ticket system.

About [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/):

Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the public’s benefit. It is a service provided by the [Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)](https://letsencrypt.org/isrg/).

We give people the digital certificates they need in order to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites, for free, in the most user-friendly way we can. We do this because we want to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.

The key principles behind Let’s Encrypt are:

* **Free**: Anyone who owns a domain name can use Let’s Encrypt to obtain a trusted certificate at zero cost.
* **Automatic**: Software running on a web server can interact with Let’s Encrypt to painlessly obtain a certificate, securely configure it for use, and automatically take care of renewal.
* **Secure**: Let’s Encrypt will serve as a platform for advancing TLS security best practices, both on the CA side and by helping site operators properly secure their servers.
* **Transparent**: All certificates issued or revoked will be publicly recorded and available for anyone to inspect.
* **Open**: The automatic issuance and renewal protocol will be published as an open standard that others can adopt.
* **Cooperative**: Much like the underlying Internet protocols themselves, Let’s Encrypt is a joint effort to benefit the community, beyond the control of any one organization.
