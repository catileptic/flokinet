_Bitcoin is a form of digital currency, created and held electronically. No one controls it. Bitcoins aren’t printed, like dollars or euros – they’re produced by people, and increasingly businesses, running computers all around the world, using software that solves mathematical problems._

## Why I should use Bitcoin?

Bitcoin enables to option to pay fast and secure and without beeing limited by your bank or payment provider. Keep in mind that often payment provider doesent like Freedom of Speech and anonymity and block these kind of services from there network.

Some Payment Provider for example do not allow to pay for anonymous services or block the usage of VPN or Tor. These limits are not existing with Bitcoin.

**1. It’s decentralized**

The bitcoin network isn’t controlled by one central authority. Every machine that mines bitcoin and processes transactions makes up a part of the network, and the machines work together.

**2. It’s easy to set up**

Conventional banks make you jump through hoops simply to open a bank account. A Bitcoin Wallet can be created within 1 minute, no papers needed.

**3. It’s anonymous**

Well, kind of. Users can hold multiple bitcoin addresses, and they aren’t linked to names, addresses, or other personally identifying information. However…

**4. It’s completely transparent**

…bitcoin stores details of every single transaction that ever happened in the network in a huge version of a general ledger, called the blockchain.

If you have a publicly used bitcoin address, anyone can tell how many bitcoins are stored at that address. They just don’t know that it’s yours.

There are measures that people can take to make their activities more opaque on the bitcoin network, though, such as not using the same bitcoin addresses consistently, and not transferring lots of bitcoin to a single address. You can also use so called Bitcoin Mixer services.

**5. Transaction fees are small**

Your bank may charge you a 10 Euro fee for transfers.

Bitcoin doesn’t. There is a so called mining fee but this is most not more then a few cents (depending on the size of your transaction)

**6. It’s fast**

You can send money anywhere and it will arrive minutes later, as soon as the bitcoin network processes the payment.
