Our location in Iceland is how we always wanted a hosting location to be. Green energy, free natural cooling and great laws when it comes to privacy. But we always missed one thing that has become so important in the recent years: DDoS protection.

No DDoS protection was available and the setups we did for our customers could only be archived by expensive solutions only large budgets could afford. Not ideal, of course. Then, the following question arose: what if a customer with a small budget would be looking for a green hosting provider while also having privacy and security (like fridaysforfuture.org, for example) ?

As our Iceland location was growing we were searching for options to solve the problem. In the third quarter of 2020 we started to perform tests with filter options of traffic from one of our POPs in Amsterdam to avoid a delay in traffic routing and in the forth quarter we finished all major setups.

We think it should not be a matter of your budget to have DDoS protection. No one should be able to take down your project with a DDoS attack because you lack the resources to fight it.

**That is why we include now free DDoS protection at our Iceland location.**

With this update, more hardware options are coming. The specifications are the same as in Romania but come with an improved L7 filter (Beta). 

Another topic of importance regarding our upgrade in Iceland was the request for hardware at a lower price. While Iceland is, in general, not a low budget location, we wanted to explore options to lower the price for dedicated servers. For this we set up several blade centers so you can now get in Iceland the G7 and G8 blades that we usually offer in Romania.

More security was also one of our goals when the update was thought out. Our KVM network in Iceland is now secured behind a VPN to ensure an extra layer of security and that all data you enter is transmitted securely.

## A short FAQ for you:

**Q: Do I have to do anything to activate the protection?**

A: There is nothing you need to do from your side, our DDoS sensor will detect any attack and filter the traffic before it reaches your server. Please keep in mind that such protection will just cover 99% and you still have to make sure your website and server is optimized to withstand attacks.

**Q: Is Layer 7 protection included?**

A: Yes, it is included. However, you will have to provide us your one year valid SSL certificate so we can install it into the filter. In our Beta setup, this is no longer required but it is not available yet for all customers.

**Q: Can I have a personalized setup with optimized rules for my application?**

A: Yes this is possible, please contact our support team for an offer.
