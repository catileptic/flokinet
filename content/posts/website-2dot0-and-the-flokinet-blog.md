Here it is – the new website with the first round of features and services like “Under Threat” for fast help in emergency situations, new services like LIR and SecureVoIP and a much better overview of our products.

Within this blog we will update you from now on about upcoming events and products and also talk about security and privacy focused topics.

Because transparency is also an important topic for us we will publish regulary transparency reports to show you how we handle legal requests.

In case you find an error on our new page (there are always some…), need a feature or just want to let us know things: info@flokinet.is is 24/7 available.
