**What’s penetration testing?**

Penetration testing is all about evaluating your application’s security before malicious attackers do.

**Understood, but why do I need that?**

Well, it sucks to get hacked. Nobody likes losing revenue because somebody leaks your customer data on pastebin.com. Such an attack doesn’t only destroy the trust relationship to your clients but could also lead to serious GDPR fines.

**Okay, but how are you testing then?**

It depends on your environment, our international team can provide you with:

* penetration tests for your online services and internal networks.
* [operational security consulting](https://flokinet.is/opsec-consulting.php).
* tailored solutions for your special needs.

Do you’ve a testing methodology?

Yep! Our web application and API penetration tests focus on the [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) and the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project), a detailed methodology can be provided on request.

Sounds good, but I heard hiring penetration testers is damn expensive?

That’s the reason why we’re doing it differently, you only pay if we find something. Furthermore existing FlokiNET clients get a 10% discount! Better get in touch soon, our capacity is limited!
