Starting last week we decided to launch a series of posts, here and on social media, regarding the basics of web hosting. We understand how confusing it might be, especially for the folks out there with limited technical understanding, to try and figure out what type of hosting they need for their website or what are the advantages and disadvantages.

Today’s topic is… VPS!

**What is a VPS?**

Short for Virtual Private Server, a VPS could be defined as a space on a server that has the characteristics of an entire server. A virtual hosting server holds it’s personal operating system, applications, resources and configurations, all of these contained in a single powerful server. Each server can have multiple VPS accounts on it.

**Who uses VPS?**

This type of hosting is generally used by people who have more traffic on their websites and shared hosting doesn’t suit them anymore. 

Also useful if you require to host your own services, such as: VoIP, XMPP or other services.

**Advantages of VPS**

It is a cost-effective option, compared to a dedicated server, for example.

You get to run your own configuration and services that might not work on shared hosting.

Fully managed services.

Good security, since your VPS is separated from other users, located on the same server.

**Disadvantages of VPS**

Configuring the server requires more technical experience.

Maintenance of services has to be done by yourself.

More expensive than shared hosting.

**A pro tip**

Preboot encryption on a VPS is pointless as the RAM that contains your encryption key can be easily read.

If you want increased security we suggest a dedicated server.

So what do you think? Is a VPS the right choice for you?
