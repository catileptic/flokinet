Next on the list of our weekly Web Hosting 101 series is shared hosting.

**What is shared hosting?**

Shared hosting is a type of web hosting in which a single physical server, a cluster or a cloud hosts multiple websites. The fact that many users access the resources of a server, helps to keep the service at a low cost. 

A shared hosting server can host hundreds of user accounts.

**Who uses shared hosting?**

Shared hosting can be mainly used by blog or small business owners with light or medium traffic on their websites.

This type of hosting is suitable for those mentioned as it does not require advanced configurations or high bandwidth.

**Advantages of shared hosting**

* Because the resources are shared by users, shared hosting is a very cost-effective option.
* It is a great option for less experienced people in the web hosting industry. 
* Easy to keep maintenance. 
* It is managed professionally. 
* FlokiNET offers **CloudLinux**, a feature that will offer server stability, density, and security by isolating each tenant and giving them allocated server resources. To find out more about CloudLinux, stay tuned for tomorrowâ€™s post. 

**Disadvantages of shared hosting**

* Sharing resources with other users, which may cause in rare occasions unbalanced performance.
* It is less flexible with applications compared to VPS or dedicated servers.
* If you suspect your website will receive a considerable amount of traffic, shared hosting might not be a good option for you.
