An open DNS recursive service for free with high security and high privacy in mind.

No data containing your IP address is ever logged in our service. Connections can use encryption if your system supports it and unlike a growing number of resolvers we do not censor your DNS.

We support DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS to allow you to encrypt your DNS traffic so untrusted networks can no longer see or tamper with the websites you look up.

All websites are encrypted today and so should your DNS traffic be.

Our DNS in Romania is reachable at

ro.resolv.flokinet.net and resolv.flokinet.net (resolv.flokinet.net will be migrated to anycast soon)

IPv4: 185.247.225.17
